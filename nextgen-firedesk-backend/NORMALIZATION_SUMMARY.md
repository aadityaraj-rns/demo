### 2. Plant Model Updated
- ✅ Normalized to match database schema
- ✅ Removed JSONB fields, replaced with foreign keys
- ✅ Renamed fields for consistency (address → addressLine1, etc.)

### 3. Model Associations Defined
- ✅ All 20+ associations configured in `models/index.js`
- ✅ Proper cascade delete rules
- ✅ Many-to-many relationships configured
- ✅ Bidirectional associations for easy querying

### 4. Controllers Created (3 new controllers)
- ✅ `normalizedPlantController.js` - Full CRUD for normalized plants
  - Create plant with nested buildings, floors, wings
  - Get all plants with associations
  - Get single plant by ID with full details
  - Update plant information
  - Delete plant (with cascades)
  
- ✅ `fireSafetyController.js` - Fire safety form management

### 5. Documentation Created
- ✅ `PLANT_NORMALIZATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete migration guide
  - Overview of changes
  - Migration steps
  - Example usage
  - Benefits of normalization
  
- ✅ Migration script template - Sequelize migration file
  - Creates all 15 new tables
  - Adds indexes for performance
  - Includes rollback support

## 📊 Database Schema Changes

### Before (Denormalized)
```
plants (1 table)
├── buildings (JSONB)
├── entrances (JSONB)
├── layouts (JSONB)
├── complianceDocuments (JSONB)
└── ... 50+ fields
```

### After (Normalized)
```
plants (core table)
├── buildings → floors → wings
├── plant_managers (junction)
├── entrances
├── diesel_generators
├── fire_safety_forms
├── compliance_fire_safety
├── monitoring_forms → monitoring_devices
└── layouts
```

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints
- Cascade delete rules
- Unique constraints on junction tables

### 2. Scalability
- Indexed foreign keys
- Normalized structure reduces redundancy
- Easy to add new relationships

### 3. Query Performance
- Proper indexes on all foreign keys
- Efficient joins with eager loading
- Optimized for read-heavy operations

### 4. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Type-safe with Sequelize DataTypes
- Well-documented relationships

## 📝 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Database Setup
1. Run the migration script to create new tables
2. Verify table structure in database
3. Test cascade delete behavior

### Phase 2: Data Migration
1. Create data migration script to move existing JSONB data
2. Migrate plants.buildings → buildings/floors/wings tables
3. Migrate manager relationships to plant_managers
4. Migrate other JSONB fields to respective tables
5. Verify data integrity after migration

### Phase 3: API Integration
1. Update routes to use new controllers
2. Add new endpoints:
   ```
   POST   /api/plants/normalized
   GET    /api/plants/normalized
   GET    /api/plants/normalized/:id
   PUT    /api/plants/normalized/:id
   DELETE /api/plants/normalized/:id
   
   POST   /api/plants/fire-safety
   GET    /api/plants/:plantId/fire-safety
   PUT    /api/plants/fire-safety/:id
   DELETE /api/plants/fire-safety/:id
   
   POST   /api/plants/compliance
   GET    /api/plants/:plantId/compliance
   PUT    /api/plants/compliance/:id
   DELETE /api/plants/compliance/:id
   ```
3. Maintain old endpoints during transition
4. Add API versioning if needed

### Phase 4: Frontend Updates
1. Update plant creation forms
2. Update plant display components
3. Add building/floor/wing management UI
4. Update fire safety forms
5. Update compliance forms

### Phase 5: Testing
1. Unit tests for all models
2. Integration tests for controllers
3. End-to-end tests for API
4. Performance testing with large datasets
5. Test cascade deletes thoroughly

### Phase 6: Deployment
1. Backup production database
2. Deploy migration in maintenance window
3. Monitor for errors
4. Gradual rollout of new features
5. Remove old JSONB fields after verification

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

### 1. Database Normalization (3NF)
- ✅ Eliminated repeating groups (buildings array → separate table)
- ✅ Removed partial dependencies
- ✅ Eliminated transitive dependencies
- ✅ Each table represents a single entity

### 2. Better Data Management
- ✅ Individual CRUD operations on buildings, floors, wings
- ✅ Referential integrity enforced by database
- ✅ Atomic updates to specific entities
- ✅ Easier to track changes and audit

### 3. Improved Query Capabilities
- ✅ Standard SQL joins instead of JSONB queries
- ✅ Can query across relationships efficiently
- ✅ Easier to generate reports
- ✅ Better support for aggregations

### 4. Scalability
- ✅ Can add new fields without schema migrations to JSONB
- ✅ Easy to add new relationships
- ✅ Better indexing opportunities
- ✅ Supports horizontal scaling
