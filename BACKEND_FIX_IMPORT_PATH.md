# Backend Fix - Import Path Correction

## Problem
The `/plant` endpoint was returning **500 Internal Server Error** because the Plant controller had an incorrect import path for the models.

### Error in Browser Console
```
GET http://localhost:3001/plant 500 (Internal Server Error)
Failed to fetch plants: Error: Failed to fetch plants
```

### Root Cause
File: `controller/organization/plant/plantController.js`

**Incorrect Import:**
```javascript
const { Plant, City, State, Industry, Manager, User } = require("../models");
```

This was trying to import from `controller/organization/models` which doesn't exist.

## Solution
Fixed the import path to correctly reference the models directory from the project root.

**Correct Import:**
```javascript
const { Plant, City, State, Industry, Manager, User } = require("../../../models");
```

This correctly imports from `models/index.js` at the project root.

## Path Explanation
```
controller/organization/plant/plantController.js
    â†‘ up 3 levels (../../../) 
models/index.js
```

- `../` â†’ `controller/organization/plant/`
- `../../` â†’ `controller/organization/`
- `../../../` â†’ `controller/` â†’ project root â†’ `models/`

## Changes Made
1. Fixed import path in `plantController.js`
2. Killed process on port 3001
3. Restarted backend server

## Verification
âœ… Backend server started successfully on port 3001
âœ… Database connected
âœ… Models loaded correctly
âœ… Socket.IO initialized

## Test Results
The plants page should now load without errors. Try:
1. Refresh the browser at `http://localhost:8080/admin/plants`
2. Plants should load successfully
3. No more 500 errors in console

## Server Log Output
```
âœ… PostgreSQL connected: firedesk@localhost:5432
âœ… Database synchronized
Creating default roles...
Role already exists: Admin
Role already exists: Manager
Role already exists: Technician
Default roles setup completed!
ðŸš€ Backend is running with Socket.IO on port: 3001
```

## Additional Notes
- This was a **backend** issue, not a frontend issue
- The frontend code was correct and working as expected
- The normalization changes to frontend are ready but disabled (using legacy endpoints)
- When you're ready to enable normalized endpoints, just change `setUseNormalizedEndpoint(false)` to `true`
